# Hack & Talk
Our initial idea is to connect restaurant, hotels etc. customers with chat agents using Google Maps integration. We want to help people seeking for specific service based on their location. There are two options:
* Customer initiates chat with chosen company by picking POI on Google Maps.
* Agent initiates discussion with customer based on the fact that selected person is close to POI.
